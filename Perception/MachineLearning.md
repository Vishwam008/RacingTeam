# Machine Learning

## Introduction and Types
### Supervised
A set of inputs and their respective labels which are then used to create a model according towhich the labels of unseen inputs can be predicted

### Unsupervised
Only a set of inputs are given while the labels are absent. This method is mainly aimed at classifying the given inputs into groups.

### Reinforced
The computer is allowed to predict the label/output for inputs given one-by-one and in the process it is told if the predicted output is correct or not.

### Classification based on required Output
<ol>
	<li>
		<h4>Classification</h4>
		A supervised problem wherein the inputs are divided into groups and fed to the learner and the learner is supposed to create a model based on which it can classify the unseen inputs into the already mentioned groups.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Regression</h4>
		Supervised problem wherein the output is continuous rather than discrete. The learner makes a model based on given inputs which predicts a function for a range of unseen inputs rather than discrete labels for each.

	<li>
		<h4>Clustering</h4>
		Unsupervised problem similar to Classification, but the groups to be classified into are not known and the inputs are given in a single bunch.
